Week 3 Project for Code Fellows 301

This program shows 3 pictures and asks the user to click their favorite picture among the 3. On click, 3 new images display. This occurs 24 more times. After the 25th vote, a list of results appears to the left and a chart displays below. The chart is a bar chart with random colors for the bar color (using random Math() functions).

There is a navigation bar at the top, but it is not functional yet as there is only one page so far.
