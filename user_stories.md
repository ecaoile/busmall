As a marketing researcher, I want to display three images to the user so that they can select their favorite.

As a developer, I want to create a website that a title with an image, a navigation menu, a section that displays 3 images to vote on, a section that displays the results after 25 selections, and a section with a footer. The images must not appear twice in two consecutive groups.
- create an array to hold all of the image references
- create an array of used images
- have used images push into the used array
- have images pop out of the used array on the next iteration

As a focus group participant, I want to be able to select one image out of three and hit a choose button. I'll then be able to repeat the process with another group of three images.
